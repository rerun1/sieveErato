## Description

Given a user number input via a form, script returns a list of primes up to that number.

Used Sieve of Eratosthenes to step through this problem. Here's how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works to find a number up to a given number:

Create a list of numbers from 2 through n: 2, 3, 4, ..., number.
Initially, let prime equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from prime, remove all multiples of prime from the list.
Increment prime by 1.
When you reach number, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes

## Objectives
- [x] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [x] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [x] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [x] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [x] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [x] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [x] Practice styling with imagery
